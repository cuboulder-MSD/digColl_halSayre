# Hal Sayer Papers Collection
## Description
The first item in the Hal Sayre Papers collection is Sayre's handwritten, first-person diary recounting the Sand Creek Massacre. The corresponding print collection includes numerous diaries, extensive personal and business material, maps, legal papers and business records. An experienced railroad and canal engineer, Hal Sayre (1835-1926) came to Colorado during the gold rush. He was one of the founders of the town of La Porte, and with his partner Ed Parmelee established a surveying office in Central City. In 1872 he became deputy mineral surveyor for the state of Colorado. In 1885 he moved to Denver and became involved in banking but maintained his Central City interests. During the early years of Colorado, Sayre had served as engineer with the Colorado Militia and served with the 3rd Colorado volunteers at the Sand Creek Massacre in 1864.
